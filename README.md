Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a commonly used non-invasive technique 
for brain tumor diagnosis

 Proposes a brain tumor region detection method using multimodal information 
fusion and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

 Different MRI modalities (T1ce, T2, Flair) provide complementary information about 
brain tissue characteristics and Combining multiple MRI modalities enhances the 
ability to differentiate tumor regions from healthy brain tissue.

 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated high accuracy in image 
recognition tasks.

 Extends 2D-CNNs to 3D-CNNs to extract tumor features across different MRI 
modalities.

 Using 3D-CNNs for brain tumor region detection enables the extraction of spatial 
and volumetric features from 3D MRI scans.
